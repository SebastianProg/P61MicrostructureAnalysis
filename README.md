# P61MicrostructureAnalysis
This library provides diffraction specific calculations mainly for analyzing residual stresses of data measured at HZG beamline P61A at PETRA III, DESY located in Hamburg. This beamline uses two energy-dispersive detectors for diffraction analysis in the energy range up to 200 keV. It is intended to perform the preprocessing of measured data with the tool P61Viewer [here](https://github.com/glebdovzhenko/P61Viewer), where result files can be exported and used for residual stress analysis.

The provided functions are basically tested with simulated and reference data but an extensive test with measured data of the target facility is still ongoing. A detailed documentation will also follow soon. To get started an example script is provided ...
